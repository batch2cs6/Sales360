Problem Statement:
This case study project focuses on the data engineering aspects of Geocart, an e-commerce ordering 
and delivery application. The objective is to enhance the shopping experience by utilizing transactional 
data and analyse it to get better insights. The project aims to design and implement a robust data 
pipeline that processes and analyzes a relational dataset of customer orders. This dataset, containing 
anonymized information from over a million orders, will be used to predict user behaviour such as 
repeat purchases, new product trials, and items added to the cart during a session. The primary goal 
is to create an efficient and scalable data engineering solution that supports accurate and real-time 
model predictions to optimize the user's shopping journey. The project will involve data ingestion, 
transformation, storage, and integration with machine learning models,ensuring a seamless and 
personalized shopping experience for Geocart users.
